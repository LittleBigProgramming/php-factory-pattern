# php-factory-pattern

Implementation of the factory pattern which is used for building of complex objects that are easily interchangable.

This is a one file implementation as a reference point of how factory patterns work. A strong working example of a php factory pattern in use is [laravel-flysystem](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Flysystem).
